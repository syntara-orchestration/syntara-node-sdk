# ADR 0006: Defer combined custom-workload image builds until catalog flow is proven

- Status: Accepted — developer-preview implementation; Execution Plane release gate retained
- Date: 2026-10-07

## Context

The current SDK has a safe separation of responsibilities. `syntara-plugin
build` compiles a plugin workspace and writes a reviewable metadata OCI archive.
`syntara-plugin publish` uploads that exact archive. Neither command builds or
pushes executable workload images.

That separation is deliberate, but a custom-workload author eventually needs a
short developer command that builds the author-owned container image, obtains
its immutable registry digest, and produces metadata pinned to that digest.
The same author should be able to put stable non-secret defaults in a settings
file instead of repeating them on every command line.

The local GitHub proof is a declarative `platform-runner` plugin, so it does
not exercise an author-owned workload image. The catalog source, browse,
documentation, installation, and workflow-builder path must be proven before
the SDK gains a container-build orchestration feature.

## Original decision

Do not implement combined workload-image construction before all of these are
proven:

- the local catalog UI can configure a source, reconcile a catalog index,
  browse a plugin, render its documentation, and install a selected immutable
  version; and
- a minimal `custom-workload` plugin can run through the Execution Plane from
  one pinned image, using the shared container ABI.

## Implementation amendment

The local catalog browse, documentation, installation, and workflow-authoring
proof has now been completed. Implement a narrowly scoped **developer preview**
for SDK packaging before the custom-workload Execution Plane proof is complete.
The preview is not evidence that a custom workload can execute successfully,
receive credentials, or meet production networking policy.

The preview adds the settings model and `build --with-workload` orchestration
below. It may build and push a custom workload image through Podman, capture
its immutable digest, write the normal metadata archive, and, when explicitly
requested, publish that archive. It must retain its preview label until the
end-to-end custom-workload Execution Plane proof is complete.

## Preview command and settings contract

A custom-workload author can use one command such as:

```bash
syntara-plugin build plugin.yaml --with-workload --verbose
```

The command must visibly perform these separate operations:

1. Validate the plugin source and its custom-workload requirements.
2. Build the author-owned OCI workload image through an explicitly selected
   local container engine; the first adapter is Podman.
3. Push that image to the configured repository and read the registry-returned
   immutable digest.
4. Build the normal plugin metadata OCI archive with the workload image bound
   to that exact `repository@sha256:...` reference.
5. Report the runtime-image digest, metadata-artifact digest, archive path,
   selected platform, and output repository. `--verbose` streams the delegated
   container-engine output; default output remains a short phase/result summary.

The feature must use one versioned, language-neutral settings model. Semantic
CLI options map one-to-one to that model and override selected settings. The
settings document has one top-level `registry` block for the shared origin,
username, plugin-metadata repository, workload-image repository, catalog-index
repository, and optional loopback-HTTP development opt-in. The workload,
metadata, and catalog publication use their distinct repository paths but do
not repeat registry identity; the SDK derives the workload's full
`host/repository` reference from that common origin. The settings-file search
order is:

1. the explicit `--settings` path;
2. `syntara-plugin.yaml` beside the selected plugin manifest;
3. `syntara-plugin.yaml` in the current working directory; then
4. safe SDK defaults.

The first matching settings file wins; settings files are not merged. Runtime
flags such as `--verbose`, `--json`, and `--dry-run`, plus secret transport
such as `--password-stdin`, remain invocation-only. Settings files must reject
passwords, access tokens, private keys, registry auth-file paths, and any other
secret value. The image platform must be explicit or sourced from an approved
settings value; a laptop's default operating system or architecture is never a
safe Execution Plane target.

The existing metadata-only `build` command remains offline and unchanged unless
`--with-workload` is selected. `--publish` is additionally required before the
convenience path publishes the metadata archive. The convenience path does not
sign artifacts, create or update a catalog index, install a plugin, or execute
a workload. A separate `catalog update` release command may create or append
to a configured catalog only after it has a verified, published plugin archive;
it is intentionally not coupled to `build --publish`.

## Consequences

- Custom-workload authors will eventually use a concise command without losing
  visibility of the two distinct OCI outputs.
- The explicit current `--image-binding` path remains available for CI and
  advanced integrations. It is not removed merely because the convenience path
  exists.
- The first implementation supports Podman only. Additional container engines
  require a separate adapter, compatibility tests, and a documented security
  review.
- The settings schema, CLI, Python API, future gRPC service, LSP, and VS Code
  extension must share the same typed validation and precedence rules.
- Local loopback HTTP remains an explicit development-only setting. Production
  settings require HTTPS and do not gain an insecure default.

## Implementation and cleanup gate

The preview requires unit tests for settings discovery/precedence, schema
validation, no-secret enforcement, Podman command construction,
target-platform validation, image-push digest capture, metadata image binding,
and verbose/redacted output. Before removing the preview label or representing
the feature as production-ready, add cancellation and failure-cleanup coverage
and prove an end-to-end custom-workload run through the Execution Plane and an
installed catalog version.

When that path is accepted, remove any temporary demo wrapper or duplicate
manual build/push instruction that it supersedes. Do not remove the explicit
metadata-only or explicit-image-binding paths until the combined path has
equivalent CI, offline, error, and security coverage.
