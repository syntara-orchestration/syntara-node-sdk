## Normative sources

The human-readable reference explains the authoring language, but the versioned
JSON Schemas under [`../contracts/schemas/v1alpha1`](../contracts/schemas/v1alpha1)
are normative. Use them for an editor integration, another language SDK, or a
strict validator. The shared test inputs are under
[`../contracts/fixtures`](../contracts/fixtures), and the container ABI source
is [`../contracts/proto/syntara_plugin/runtime/protocol/container.proto`](../contracts/proto/syntara_plugin/runtime/protocol/container.proto).
